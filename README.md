1. The Customer is the person who has a cloth to wash. He registers in the platform and when ever he has a cloth to wash he will make a cloth request.
2. The Rider is the bike man who goes to pick up the cloth which the Laundry has accepted. Once the Laundry accepts a cloth request the biker still within the location of the laundry will see the laundry pickup and will accept or reject the pickup request.
3. The Laundry is the washman or washwoman who registers in the platform as a service provider. Once the cloth request is made the Laundry will see the request based on location and will either accept or reject the request.
4. The Admin is like a support who overseas the activities that happens in the platform. The Admin can automatically assign a cloth request to laundry and can also automatically assign a pickup request to a rider.
